    <h3>Jhinuk Barman. Welcome to my page!</h3>
    <p>
      I graduated from UC Berkeley with a major in Data Science. I am currently working in tech at UCSF. I became interested in design after taking an illustrator course last year. I am using the Macbook Pro.

      I had trouble with properly storing the git repository files and with running grunt. I was able to fix these errors by running grunt on a different port and restarting terminal/switching files over into git! I also had trouble with setting my dreamhost server but I was able to remove files using the rm -rf filename command. I was also able to see my CSS updates using the command-shift-R command to reload Chrome.
